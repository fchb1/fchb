# TikTok Strategy for Mobile Detailing Business

A comprehensive guide to growing your mobile detailing business on TikTok.

## Understanding the TikTok Algorithm

### What TikTok Rewards:
1. **Watch Time**: Keep viewers watching until the end
2. **Engagement**: Likes, comments, shares, saves
3. **Completion Rate**: Percentage who watch full video
4. **Re-watches**: People watching multiple times

- Quick exits (people swiping away fast)
- Low engagement
- Watermarks from other platforms

**Good Hooks for Detailing:**
- Start with the worst/grossest part
- Use shocking text overlays
- Lead with dramatic transformations
- Begin with a question or bold statement

**Effects:**

## Hashtag Strategy Deep Dive
