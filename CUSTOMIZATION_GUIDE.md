# Customization Guide

Make this tool truly yours by customizing it for your specific mobile detailing business.

## Quick Customizations

### 1. Add Your Business Name & Location

Find this section in `content_generator.py`:

```python
self.hashtag_groups = {
    "location": [
        "#MobileDetailer",
        "#LocalBusiness",
        "#SupportLocal",
        "#SmallBusinessOwner"
    ]
}
```

Replace with:

```python
self.hashtag_groups = {
    "location": [
        "#MobileDetailer",
        "#MiamiDetailing",      # Your city
        "#FloridaDetailer",     # Your state
        "#SouthFloridaCars",    # Your region
        "#305Detailing"         # Your area code
    ]
}
```

### 2. Add Your Signature Services

Find the `topics` list:

```python
self.topics = [
    "Interior deep clean",
    "Exterior wash and wax",
    # Add your services here
]
```

Add your unique services:

```python
self.topics = [
    "Interior deep clean",
    "Exterior wash and wax",
    "Marine vinyl restoration",  # Your specialty
    "RV detailing",              # Your specialty
    "Boat detailing",            # Your specialty
    "Fleet detailing",           # Your specialty
]
```

### 3. Create Your Brand Voice

Find the `hooks` list and add your personality:

```python
self.hooks = [
    "Wait until you see what I pulled out of this car! ðŸ˜±",
    # Add your hooks here
]
```

Examples for different brand voices:

**Professional/Educational:**
```python
"Here's what 10 years of detailing experience taught me:",
"Professional tip: This is how you should really clean your car",
"The difference between $50 and $500 detailing:",
```

**Funny/Relatable:**
```python
"I'm never eating in my car again after seeing this ðŸ¤®",
"Tell me you have kids without telling me you have kids:",
"This customer said 'it's not that bad' ðŸ’€",
```

**Luxury/Premium:**
```python
"Elevating automotive excellence, one detail at a time âœ¨",
"This is what premium detailing looks like ðŸ”¥",
"Luxury car care at your doorstep ðŸš—ðŸ’Ž",
```

### 4. Add Your Pricing Tiers

Add a new method to the generator class:

```python
def get_pricing_context(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Return your business pricing for content"""
    return {
        "basic": {
            "name": "Express Detail",
            "price": "$79",
            "duration": "1-2 hours"
        },
        "standard": {
            "name": "Complete Detail",
            "price": "$149",
            "duration": "3-4 hours"
        },
        "premium": {
            "name": "Premium Package",
            "price": "$299",
            "duration": "6-8 hours"
        }
    }
```

### 5. Add Your Contact Information

Add a new attribute:

```python
def __init__(self):
    self.business_info = {
        "name": "Your Business Name",
        "phone": "(555) 123-4567",
        "email": "info@yourdetailing.com",
        "website": "www.yourdetailing.com",
        "booking_link": "book.yourdetailing.com",
        "service_area": "Miami & Surrounding Areas"
    }
```

Then update the post generation to include CTAs with your info:

```python
def generate_post(self, topic: str = None) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    # ... existing code ...
    
    return {
        # ... existing fields ...
        "call_to_action": f"ðŸ“² Book now: {self.business_info['booking_link']}",
        "service_area": self.business_info['service_area']
    }
```

## Advanced Customizations

            "Beat the heat with a cool clean car",
            "Summer road trip prep",
            "Protect against sun damage"
        ],
